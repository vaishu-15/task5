            The writer behind the blog is Melissa, a girl that started her
            adventures around the world at the age of 25. She lived in many
            different countries and she is a really experienced traveler.
          There was a time in which looking for inspiration and advice for travelers was harder. The only possible source was buying travel guides, and they had to spend a lot of money to get them.

          Every time they had to plan a trip, they had to buy a guide about the country they were going to visit. But today, thanks to Internet, everything is easier, and of course, even planning a trip.

           Today you don’t have to buy a different guide every time you want to travel, you just type on your computer what you are looking for and you get your answers immediately. And this is thanks to travel blogs.

           Travel blogs are like traditional travel guides, with some differences. 

              The main difference is that they are not written by professional writers but by travelers, just like you, and in this way you can find really useful and easy advice. Everything that you read, has been tested in first person by the person who wrote about it. So, in a sense, it’s like you can “touch” the information you read, and they seem more authentic.

           The other difference is that they are easier to access than traditional guides. Just type what you need and you'll find it. And you can be specific about i: if you just care about food, you can find only food information; if you want to know about sightseeing, you'll find it, and so on.

          And, best thing, they are free! You access travel blogs and read them for free!

           While you don’t spend money to read travel blog, on the contrary travel bloggers can earn money if you read their blogs. And this is good, because in this way everybody is happy. They can earn just as every other writer. 

            They do it thanks to affiliate market or some advertisement, so today being a travel blogger can be considered as a real job. A travel job, to be more specific, because they can work while traveling, they just need Internet connection.

          This is a huge revolution for travel world. A revolution which is a benefit for everyone, both travelers and writers.
          
          And now, let’s see together the best travel blogs to find inspiration for your next travel.
